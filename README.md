# danembed
Embed Dan's leaderboard, anywhere!

Embed Code:
```html
  <iframe src="https://alimadcorp.github.io/danembed/?publicKey=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY" height="300px" width="100%"></iframe>
```
Replace YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY with the public key of your leaderboard, and you are good to go!
You can change the width and height as you want to.
This embed will automatically show the "Extra" field if any of the entries in the leaderboard have it. To disable this field, append 'extra=false' to the end of the src url.
